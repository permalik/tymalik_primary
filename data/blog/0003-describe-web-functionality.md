## Primary Outlook

Browsers are web interfaces built for purposeful user interaction.

Coupled with search engines, browsers may be leveraged to locate desired web addresses and display such material for an end-userâ€™s experience.

The sequence for getting web sites or web applications and serving them up is comprised of four steps: fetch, process, display and store.

### Fetch

Here data is retrieved from web servers and provisioned for browsers to subsequently produce as output.

This action occurs at the network layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.

The network layer exists at packet level, whereby data packets are routed through routers from one particular network node address to the intended node destination.

The addresses attributed to respective web sites and applications are formatted as Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).

These specific directions dictate routes, such that desired packets may be found and called for via HTTP/FTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/File Transfer Protocol).

Search engines (DuckDuckgo, Google, Yahoo, Bing, Dogpile, Yippy, etc.) are purposed to parse databases and provide sought information.

When the web destination administers a cache, a current copy of the data is created and held in app cache or service workers for the next visit. Caching improves response times by eliminating both loading and network requests.

### Process

This procedure is one of taking the routed data and passing it to the display engine after each type of program instructions are parsed.

With the aid of render engines (such as Gecko, Blink, EdgeHTML, Trident, WebKit, etc.), HTML and CSS are made usable by manipulation.

HTML is converted into an object termed the DOM (Document Object Model) tree.

CSS stylesheets are parsed, such that respective styles may be determined for all elements. Then a render tree is formed by combining both the parsed HTML and CSS.

The render tree establishes rules for layout and painting.

Layout indicate exactly where elements are to be placed in the viewport and what size they should appear. Painting then provides all other styling for elements.

In addition to HTML and CSS, JavaScript must also be parsed before it may be made actionable by display engines. Common JavaScript engines include SpiderMonkey, Chrome V8, Chakra and JavaScriptCore.

The division of each JavaScript engine is represented by the memory heap and the call stack.

The memory heap functions to allocate memory for variables, functions or any other JavaScript elements.

The call stack is a comprisal of stack frames or sequential browser execution steps.

### Display

The User Interface (UI) for individual browsers varies.

However each is outfitted with a standard set of tools and a viewport to house the fetched packet data.

Every browser engine enables page load and navigation, as well as hooks for viewing certain browsing processes and querying to alter render engine settings.

### Storage

By way of persistence, data may be kept and used for multiple operations. Using local storage, session storage, cookies, app cache, service workers, etc., improved performance and other types of functionality are made possible.

## Final Thoughts

The capabilities and methods by which the web operates can be both subtle and by contrast, overwhelming.

The simplest approach to understanding the current state of the web lies in realizing the value of each step.

In short, the web is a process of both seeking and presenting data.
