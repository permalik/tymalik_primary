## Primary Outlook

Putting together a computer is really no trouble.

Throughout the process are plenty of potential issues which may be tough to resolve; and sure, this is true.

But as long as the hardware is in fair (enough) condition, much frustration may be avoided.

With a small time investment, the assembly of a working PC is not beyond the capabilities of most casual computer users.

## Necessary Hardware

Computers complete tasks by leveraging individual components, each with differing functionality.

**The list looks like this...**

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

Responsible for getting things done.

Referred to interchangably as a processor or microprocessor, the CPU is responsible for completing various tasks.

CPUs are fragile, thin silicon wafers armed with billions of transistors (switches).

An exterior shell provides the CPU an intermediate point of contact. As computing operations release heat, this shell allows improved cooling of the processor.

CPU performance can be quanitified using standard units. These units are based on segments of time. Each of those segments represents a task being accomplished.

Such segments are referred to commonly as cycles. The measurement of these cycles follows an established metric.

**For instance:**

- An individual cycle may be expressed as 1 hertz (Hz).

- Rather if it were billions of cycles per second, the appropriate quantifier would be gigahertz (GHz).

### Motherboard (System Board)

Communication bridge for computer hardware components.

The motherboard’s purpose is to allow communication between all computer components and is thereby directly or indirectly connected with each.

An onboard chipset is responsible for informing buses (pathways) how fast they may run and allow transfer of data between memory slots.

Despite variation among models, motherboards are circuit boards (produced varied shapes and sizes, or form factors.)

For every motherboard there is a particular flavor of CPU. Such relations are established by number of processor pins, processor manufacturer, etc.

A standalone program, namely firmware, exists on every motherboard. This type of software can present as one, a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) or a Basic Input Output System (BIOS).

### Random Access Memory (RAM)

Short-term system recollection.

Actively executing operations and sections of memory are stored within a solid-state component.

In order to store such information, computer system must be receiving power and booted.

A table is then used by this component to organize what data is retained and where.

"Sticks" of RAM present as long, thin circuit boards called Dual Inline Memory Modules (DIMMs) which run parallel to one another and perpendicular to the motherboard onto which they are mounted.

Standard PCs maintain this structure, whereas laptop computers use a varied type of RAM called Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Modules (SODIMMs). These alternative RAM entities are angled nearly parallel the motherboard.

Single Data Rate (SDR) is near obsolete insofar as RAM speed is considered. This metric would operate once per clock instance in respect to the motherboard’s system timer.

Double Data Rate (DDR) alternatively, can both send and receive data twice per each motherboard clock tick.

DDR is classified by four separate speed ratings: DDR, DDR2, DDR3 and DDR4. Each iteration of DDR transfers data successively faster.

Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) will only retain its memory while the computer is receiving power; thus it must constantly be refreshed.

### Storage Device

Long-term system retention.

Multiple options are available for maintaining data banks within a computer system.

Any information which a computer might be interested in storing can be found in operating systems and file systems.

The operating system maintains the file system.

A file system can be divided then into directories, each containing individual files or even other directories.

Storage devices are used in the long-term storage of such directories and files.

Hard Drive Disks (HDDs) are metal cartridges with stacks of metal platters sealed inside.

HDDs operate magnetically. Data is encoded as patterns of positive and negative polarity. The patterns are then mapped to a magnetic medium.

Solid-State Drives (SSDs) are lighter, faster, quieter and (overall) more efficient vessels for storage.

SSDs leverage nonvolatile memory, as do standard disk hard drives. Solid-state technology can also be observed in USB flash drives and flash memory cards such as Secure Digital (SD), MicroSD, MemoryStick and CompactFlash.

Optical drives function by reading reflected laser light from optical discs. Types of optical discs include Compact Discs (CDs), Digital Video Discs (DVDs) and BluRay Discs.

### Graphic Processing Unit (GPU, Graphic Card or Video Card)

Video output processing.

These processors accept video or graphic signals and output them to the display.

Models perform at differing rates. Some allow base-level video capability, while others gradually display greater and greater quality.

A GPU is a circuit board with its own chipset and cooling fan. Each card will have a dedicated number of connections into which output devices may be plugged.

### Power Supply Unit (PSU)

Constant energy resource.

A metal box with a protruding wire bundle is mounted within the computer case.

That metal box is the power supply and each wire has a its own preferred component.

Power supplies receive power as Alternating Current (AC) from the wall outlet then convert it to Direct Current (DC). While converting AC to DC, the power supply steps down the voltage into precise doses for each computer component.

All power supplies receive ratings (such as 80%, Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.)

Ratings signify how much AC is capable of being converted to DC. They reveal how efficient each power supply truly is.

### Assembly Procedures

**Tools:**

- flathead & philips screwdriver
- flashlight
- various tools if installing extra functionality
- organized, well-lit workspace (optional)

#### Mount Motherboard

Mount positions within the case correspond with those on the motherboard.

Line up and fasten screws.

#### Attach CPU

Gloves may be preferred, as they might prevent transmission of unwanted oils onto CPU pins.

Using either a specialized tool or hand, clutch processor by corners and line up pins with slot on motherboard.

Avoid forcing into place.

Once CPU is comfortably in place, slide bar and lock it together with motherboard.

Appending a cooling fan calls for thermal paste.

For this, apply a thin layer of paste to CPU shell.

Match and press them together, then secure with screws.

#### Insert RAM

Place each perpendicular into dedicated motherboard slots.

Alternate sticks appropriately.

#### Attach GPU

Fasten the GPU to the Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) slot on the motherboard then mount within the case with screws.

#### Install Power Supply

Connect components with power supply using appropriate cables.

House power supply box within case.

#### Insert Hard Drives

Whether disk drive or solid-state, hard drives should be placed and locked into provided bays inside the case.

## Final Thoughts

This process should be quite straight-forward. And while this project is not terribly complex, a successful build can provide the confidence to continue onto more advanced concepts.
