# Build a PC

## Assembling a Desktop Computer

### Primary Outlook

Putting together a computer is really no trouble.

Throughout the process are plenty of potential issues that can be tough to resolve.

And sure this is true.

But as long as the hardware is in fair (enough) condition, much frustration may be avoided.

With a small time investment, the assembly of a working PC is not beyond the capabilities of most casual computer users.

### Necessary Hardware

Computers complete tasks by leveraging individual components, each with differing functionality.

The list looks like this...

#### CPU (Central Processing Unit)

The CPU is the component in a PC build which gets things done.

Referred to interchangably as a processors or microprocessors, CPUs are responsible for completing various tasks.

CPUs are fragile, thin silicon wafers armed with billions of transistors (switches).

A shell provides each CPU an exterior point of contact.

As the operations of computing release heat, this shell allows cooling of the processor.

A given CPU's performance may be quanitified with standard units.

These units are based on segments of time.

Each of those segments represents a task being accomplished.

Such segments are referred to commonly as cycles.

The measurement of these cycles follows an established metric.

For instance:

An individual cycle may be expressed as 1 hertz (Hz).

Rather if it were billions of cycles per second, the appropriate quantifier would be gigahertz (GHz).

#### Motherboard (System Board)

As every piece of hardware plugs (directly or indirectly) into the motherboard, its existence is vital. The motherboard’s goal is one of allowing communication between all computer components.

Each model of motherboard boasts its own distinct features. That said, they are all circuit boards (produced in appropriately varied shapes and sizes, i.e., form factors). Moreover, they do not solely exist as pathways for computational traffic. Rather, an onboard chipset is responsible for informing buses (pathways) as to how fast they can run and allow transfer of data between memory slots.

Particular motherboards will only support their own flavor of CPU. Every motherboard may only be used with its properly related (CPU) counterpart. These relations are established by things such as, the number of processor pins and processor manufacturer.

A standalone program, namely firmware, exists on every motherboard. This type of setup software can present as one,
a UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) or a BIOS (Basic Input Output System).

RAM (Random Access Memory)

Short-term system recollection. While the computer system is powered on, executing operations and sections of memory are stored within a solid-state component. A table is used by this component to organize what data is retained and where.

"Sticks" of RAM present as long, thin circuit boards called DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Modules), which run parallel to each other and perpendicular to the motherboard onto which they are mounted.

Standard PCs maintain this structure, wherein DIMMs can be found slotted perpendicular to the motherboard. However, laptop computers use a varied type of RAM called SODIMMs (Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Modules). These alternative RAM entities are angled nearly parallel the motherboard.

SDR (Single Data Rate) is near obsolete insofar as RAM speed is considered. This metric would operate once per clock instance in respect to the motherboard’s system timer.

DDR (Double Data Rate), alternatively, can both send and receive data twice per each motherboard clock tick.

DDR is classified by four separate speed ratings: DDR, DDR2, DDR3 and DDR4. Each iteration of DDR transfers data successively faster.

DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) will only retain its memory while the computer is receiving power; and thus, it must constantly be refreshed.
Storage Device

Long-term system retention. Various options are available when it comes to maintaining banks of data within a computer system. Requisite data which need be stored by computers exists as entities such as operating systems and file systems (file systems can be broken down into directories containing individual files or even other directories). The following will give some detail regarding magnetic storage and solid-state storage.

HDDs (Hard Drive Disks) are metal cartridges with stacks of metal platters sealed inside. These disks operate by magnetic means, wherein data is encoded as patterns of positive and negative polarity. The patterns are then mapped to a magnetic medium.

SSDs (Solid-State Drives) are lighter, faster, quieter and (overall) more efficient vessels for storage. SSDs leverage nonvolatile memory, as do standard, disk hard drives. Nonvolatile memory is more permanently retained by certain storage devices, whereas RAM is volatile and "forgets" after a loss of power. Solid-state technology can also be observed in USB flash drives and flash memory cards such as SD (Secure Digital), MicroSD, MemoryStick and CompactFlash.

Optical drives are devices which function by way of reading amounts of reflected laser light from optical discs. Types of optical discs include CDs (Compact Discs), DVDs (Digital Video Discs) and BDs (BluRay Discs).
Video Card (Graphics Card, Graphics Processor or Display Adapter)

Enables video output. These cards accept video or graphic signals and output them to the display. Every model will perform at a differing rate from the next. Some allow less video capability, while others can gradually display more and more quality.

A video card is a circuit board with its own chipset and cooling fan. Each card will have a dedicated number of connections into which output devices may be plugged.
PSU (Power Supply Unit)

Responsible for feeding consistent energy to an operating computer system.

The power supply is presented as a metal box which is mounted within the computer case itself. Running out of the box is a bundle of wires, each of which leads to its own dedicated component.

Tasks of power supplies are to receive power in AC (Alternating Current) from the wall outlet and convert it to DC (Direct Current). While converting AC to DC, the power supply steps down the voltage into precise doses for each computer component.

All power supplies receive ratings (such as 80%, Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.). Each rating signifies the percentage of AC which is capable of being converted to DC. These ratings reveal how efficient each power supply truly is.
Assembly Procedures

First, gather any tools you may need. In many scenarios (where both parts and expectations are base line), the only tools you may need are a Philips screwdriver and maybe a flashlight. Of course, other precautions and features can be instantiated. But, given your desire is one of making the prior list of components function as a whole system, this is about the extent of the tool set.

All components and implements are now allocated and its time to set up a workspace. The place in which you intend to assemble is dependent upon preference. Once you are at the site, however, lighting is a helpful subject of consideration. You will be working with small connectors, screws and valuable pieces of technology, so the ability to see everything well is useful.

In addition to visibility is the option to maintain a dedicated space for any parts you intend to remove and/or add into the build. Knowing where all materials are can keep things from becoming messy or misplaced.

Now everything is ready and step one is to open your chosen case. Inside the case will be mounting positions for the motherboard. The spots fated for the motherboard are small screw holes which will line up with the holes found on the edges of each motherboard. Line things up accordingly and use the appropriate screws and motherboard mounts to fix the board into the case. The motherboard mounts (themselves) are small metal extensions which will allow the board to fasten away from the case, rather press against the metal frame of your case. If that is not clear, you probably don’t want the board resting against the metal.

The next step is one of attaching the CPU to your motherboard. You may wear gloves if you like, to keep from transmitting any unwanted oils onto the pins. Clutch the processor by its corners and the pins will line up exactly with the slot on the board. If you are attempting to force the processor into place, something is not correct. After the components are joined, slide down the locking bar to finish this step.

If you intend to attach a cooling fan onto the CPU, you will need a small portion of thermal paste. This paste is referred to by many terms. That said, the stuff you want is a type of lubricant with additive silver in the compound. The paste can be found in small plastic syringes.

Apply a thin and even layer to the shell of the CPU, careful not to let any paste run down into the processor or board. After successful, match up the fan to the CPU and press them together. Subsequently, screws should be available to finish securing the two together.

RAM can now be inserted. If you are installing multiple pieces, again, each stick will run parallel to its counterpart and perpendicular to the board itself. One side of the RAM stick will bear a shorter line of connections than the other. One by one, properly and evenly line up the sticks and firmly press them into the slots. There may be locking mechanisms which will signify the sticks are settled. If so, investigate each lock such that it is working properly.

If you do not plan to use your CPU’s onboard graphics, now is a good time to attach your video card. Head to the motherboard and look
for the PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) slot. Once located, installation of the video card is like that of the RAM. Line up the card with the slot and press until attached.

The last integral step in assembling your computer (outside fitting the power supply) is installing your storage device(s). Whether you decide to use HDDs or SSDs, they both will need to be slid into their respective docking bays. These bays will accept two main sizes of hard drive, 2.5” and 3.5”. Apply the correct fastening hardware and lock the drive into place.

Time for the final step: adding your power supply. In the corner or side of your case, you will find a specific area for mounting. After everything is snug, attach all components with the cables which extend from the power supply. Now, you may seal the case to your new computer. After powering on your device and providing it with an operating system, you will have a functioning desktop computer.
Final Thoughts

This was a set of steps which will enable you to construct your own PC from a considerably basic list of possible parts. Many other components can be added and multiple steps, to boot. When assembling your device, you may find that adjusting the order above will fit your needs more aptly. That, however, is for you to decide on a case-by-case basis.
