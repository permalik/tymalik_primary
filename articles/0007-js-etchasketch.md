## Primary Outlook

The purpose of this application is interactive painting/erasing and board resize/reset.

This clone will be built using event listeners.

### Structure

Create three components: header, a section for the canvas and a section for interactive controls.

### Functionality

The aforementioned components are meant to draw the canvas, present color options, the ability to shake/clear the canvas and a component to resize the canvas dimensions.

Using JavaScript, users should be able to vary the scale of the canvas with the provided interface.

Other JavaScript functions should be in place to alter the pen color (grey-scale or otherwise.)

## Final Thoughts

This project was helpful in understanding DOM traversal and styling.
