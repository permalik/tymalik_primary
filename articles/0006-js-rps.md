## Primary Outlook

The concept of RPS is simple.

Building this game game requires user input and DOM traversal.

### Structure

I need a section for the user move list, a display area for each rounds' scores and a place for announcing winners.

### Functionality

My goal for this game is core functionality and some stylistic behavior which makes the game title flash random colors (like that of old-school arcade games.)

### Logic

The user will have an option of rock, paper or scissors from the respective HTML buttons.

The computer will make a randomized decision about what move to make.

Conditonal statements are used to determine the victor.

The random color generator is built with event listeners.

Upon window load, a colorRandomizer function will quickly alternate the colors displayed in the application header.

## Final Thoughts

This project was a great exercise in conditional statements and traversing the DOM.

Using multiple instances of random number generation has made me more confident in using such a process in the future.

Modularization was also certainly a benefit in reading how things were being triggered from one set of functionality to the next
