## Discussing the Internet’s Past, Present and Beyond

### A Brief History (as we know it)

The internet was first envisioned as a globally interconnected network of computers where everybody could access data and programs from any site.

As initially imagined, this conceptual system was dreamed up by J.C.R. Licklider. In August 1962, Licklider proposed his concept of a "Galactic Network".

Licklider documented his idea in a series of memos — the modern internet with which we have today become quite fond starkly resembles concepts from these very memos.

An MIT graduate, Licklider was also the first head of the computer research program at DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) circa October 1962.

During his time at DARPA Licklider convinced his to-be-successors, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor and Lawrence G. Roberts of the value the proposed network held.

Into the late 1960s a plan for ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency NETwork) was devised.

The intended method for execution was one of using packet switching to transfer data and messages, rather utilizing circuits alone.

By the end of 1969 the initial incarnation of ARPANET was successfully off the ground.

This version leveraged four host computers, addressed problems of refresh and also dealt with 3-D representation over the net.

Over time it was indeed ARPANET which blossomed into The Internet.

The emerging internet was created with a vision that eventually there would be multiple independent networks, each with varying design.

This meta-level internetworking architectural model allows individual networks to be selected by providers, so as to employ the capabilities of their respective networks and interwork with others.

The Internet, born from a single packet switching network, has become an enormity of networks enabling worldwide communication and much more.

### Behind the Curtain Functionality

The internet is generally comprised of two coexisting groups of technology.

Entirely reliant upon one another, hardware and data work in synchronicity to transport information.

#### Hardware

Hardware can be thought of as any solid piece of technology involved in computing. There are a remarkable number hardware types, so we will recount but a few of them here.

Any device capable of integrating with the internet such as a phone, radio, satellite, laptop, desktop computer or server is an example of hardware which can receive and/or output information before or after processing.

Some hardware is not managed directly by the _royal_ user, but is considered hardware nonetheless. These types of objects could be modems, routers, cellphone towers and even the cables which physically connect such devices.

#### Electrical and Encoded

Hardware exists for some reasons.

Those reasons are of accepting data, storing it, parsing it, manipulating it and sending it to other hardware. The cycle then continues … and so forth.

Data (at its essence) can be perceived as thoughts, concepts or the modification of either.

It is from this definition that we break down such content into facts, opinions or the outcome of calculations.

With a firm definition of what data really is, how is it transferred throughout networks?

By way of energy signals and frequencies, data is passed from one place to the next.

There are many forms of data transmission: electrical, magnetic, photic, radiational, etc.

After these data fragments are sent from one set of hardware, they are then input or received by another.

Every computational device is only capable of understanding data that has first been translated in such a way that a machine can reason its value.

Various encoding methods and inter-operative languages exist as means of enacting these imperative translations.

#### Producing Information

Once hardware and data have performed their duties of computation and transference, the next step is one of outputting the data as information which might be observed by a user.

This portion of the computational progression is where we (as humans) take in and utilize intellectual material for various purposes.

Utilization of such information is not limited to humans.

Instead hardware is also capable of sending data to other hardware by way of automation, programming or artificial intelligence.

### The Future Interweb

The working concept for the internet was built around the Internet Protocol (IP). Network communication is made possible as data is passed from one destination to the next via packets.

The Internet Protocol is an established method for directing each packet to the proper location. Without the Internet Protocol, the internet as we know it would simply not be possible.

The original iteration of IP was IPv4. This is still today the most widely used protocol.

Today, another version of IP exists. IPv6 is the successor to IPv4 and has been deployed to the public now for around two decades.

Throughout the history of the internet, IPv4 address locations have begun to dwindle.

Thus the instantiated IPv6 will gradually take its place and offer a significantly larger number of nodes where stored data may live in the internet.

Fully adopting IPv6 will grow the internet substantially.

This new version has actually been around for sometime now.

But, when it is fully realized, the amount of possible IP addresses will truly be massive.
