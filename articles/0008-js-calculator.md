## Primary Outlook

This is my process for constructing an interactive calculator with simple arithmetic operations.

The intended functionality for this application includes: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, positive/negative toggling and support for floats.

The logic I used to create this project leverages DOM values, thus providing valid calculations.

### Structure

A section is used to contain the operation interface, as well as one for the keyboard for user-input numbers.

### Logic

Users can input numbers for calculation.

Such input is used for calculation against the next.

Input is made to be evalutated without any adverse results.

## Final Thoughts

Clear logic was essential in the process of building this application.
