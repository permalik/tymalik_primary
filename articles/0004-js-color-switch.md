## Primary Outlook

Building a color switch requires some form of user input.

I chose to use a math quiz to prompt for such input.

After accurately answering questions, a series of color switches are produced.

These switches allow a user to momentarily paint the background of the viewport.

### Structure

The first section houses a div for containing my color switch interface.

Within this interface, math questions are asked and answers are prompted for.

Additionally, another section is used to insert the switch. This section enables user interactivity, displaying a message when the propmt is answered correctly.

### Functionality

With each correct answer, the interface needs to be removed while the respective color switch is displayed.

After the interface is removed, an animation will present with a clickable circle.

When the circle is clicked, the background color should transition to and from the first "color switch".

## Final Thoughts

This project has made me comfortable with selecting HTML elements from the DOM and manipulating them based off user input.

Using if-else chains, I was able to successfully achieve functionality.

The random positioning of button switches helped me understand the concept of random number generation.

And writing functions for chronological user expectation, showed me how I should think about patterning my code.
